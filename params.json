{"name":"Redtimer","tagline":"Landing page for RedTimer","body":"### Welcome to RedTimer\r\n\r\nThis reductionist timer lets you work time-boxed and undisturbed. Click start and begin working. The timer will automatically set itself to 25 minutes. This amount of time is a very effective way to work. A decent vibration will remind you of your hard-earned break.\r\n\r\nThe app keeps the screen unlocked and bright red until the timer fires. It dims and locks the iPhone after that. The red color signals your friends and colleagues not to disturb you.\r\n\r\nInstall RedTimer on your kids' Apple gadgets. Show them that focus is a key factor for increased productivity and thus more free time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
